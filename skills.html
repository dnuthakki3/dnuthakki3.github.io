											<h2>Leadership</h2>
												<p>Through my many years as an officer on my school's FBLA Officer Team, I have learned valuable knowledge on how organizations are run as well as how they are managed. I have learned that leadership is a two way street where both parties contribute to help one another out in meaningful ways.</p>
											<h2>Security Knowledge</h2>
												<p>By finishing the cybersecurity pathway that my school offers, I have amassed a considerate amount of knowledge on security. Additionally, through my internship at Siemens Energy, I have found an outlet to actually apply said technical knowledge in a nuanced and professional manner.</p>
											<h2>Web-Development</h2>
												<p>During my experience with the Georgia Student Technology Competition, I got exposure to both the designing of websites as well as how to manage a connection to a SQL Database. For a further demonstration, feel free to check out the video explanation <a href = https://youtu.be/Q11grBcMSkQ target = "_blank">here</a></p>
											<h2>Excel Proficient</h2>
												<p>At my internship at Siemens Energy and competitive events with FBLA, I have accumulated a decent amount of knowledge when it comes to the basics of Excel spreadsheets. I also have a bit of experience with Visual Basic and how to code macros.</p>
											<h2>Quick Learner</h2>
												<p>Through the multitude of rigor courses I have taken in high school as well as the number of languages I have had to learn, I have become adept at being able to pick up knowlege rather quickly. This has helped me greatly in both school and my extracurriculars.</p>
