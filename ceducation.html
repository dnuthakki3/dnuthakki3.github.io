									<h2>Current Project</h2>
										<p>I have undertaken many different opportunities to enrich my knowledge about cybersecurity and the industry as a whole to ensure that I have relevant knowledge in the field. Currently, I am learning the C and C++ languages to make a ransomware project. It has shown me how the principles of Object Oriented Programming that I learned in Java are held constant in all Object Oriented Programming languages. Additionally, by making the ransomware I am able to see exactly how hackers target certain weaknesses in operating systems. It has been a very enriching experience that has helped me work on both new languages and understand the behind the scenes work of how ransomware works.</p>
									<h2>Career-Related Education</h2>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Cybersecurity Pathway:</strong> 3 years of Cybersecurity coursework done in school. I am currently in the optional 4th year research capstone project course. I have also completed a few certifications that include:</li>
											<ul>
												<li>CompTIA Security+</li>
												<li>MTA Networking Fundamentals</li>
											</ul>
											<li><strong>Cyberavengers:</strong> A club in my highschool that focuses on giving students real world experience with different competitions and Capture the Flag (CTF) type events. Some of the competitions I have been involved in include:</li>
											<ul>
												<li>CyberPatriot</li>
												<li>The National Cyber League</li>
												<li>Cyberstart</li>
												<li>National Governors Association CTF</li>
											</ul>
										</ul>
									<h2>Educational Enhancement</h2>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Siemens Energy Cybersecurity Intern:</strong> Research many different security tools that are used in the industry. For proprietary reasons I cannot disclose which tools I have researched, but I have also gotten a lot of experience with using Excel through the different projects that I have worked on.</li>
